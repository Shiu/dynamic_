## Configuration Logic

### Presence Detection

The integration uses presence sensors to detect occupancy in a room. When presence is detected and `Manage On Presence` is enabled, controlled entities will turn on (subject to light level if a light sensor is configured).

- `Short Absence Threshold`: Prevents devices from turning off during brief absences (like walking between rooms), and also protects against short dropouts of presence detection
- `Presence Timeout`: How long to wait after presence is lost before turning off devices
- `Active Room Threshold`: Time required for continuous presence before considering a room "active"
- `Active Room Timeout`: Longer timeout period for rooms that were previously "active"

### Light Level Control

If a light sensor is configured:

- Lights will only turn on automatically if the room is darker than `Light Threshold`
- This prevents unnecessary light activation during daylight hours

### Manual Control

The integration includes smart handling of manual device control:

- `Remote Control Timeout`: If you manually turn on lights in an empty room, they will turn off after this timeout unless presence is detected
- Manual device states are remembered while the room is occupied
- When leaving a room:
  - If all lights were off, states clear immediately
  - If all lights were on, states clear after presence timeout
  - If lights were mixed (both on and off), states are preserved

### Night Mode

Night mode provides additional control during specified hours:

- `Night Mode Scale`: Multiplies all timeouts during night mode (0.5 = half the normal duration)
- `Night Mode Override On Presence`: Prevents automatic device activation during night hours
- `Night Mode Entities Add Mode`:
  - Exclusive: Only night mode entities are controlled
  - Additive: Night mode entities are added to normal entities

## TODO

This is very early stages, so some initial testing will be required before any future plans are finalized.
